## hyper-applescripts

These are a set of useful AppleScript apps that can be used to interact with the [Hyper](https://hyper.is) terminal app on MacOS.  Simply clone this repo and start using.

### Scripts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap style="font-size: 1.5em">hyper-new-window<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danlynn/hyper-applescripts/master/assets/hyper-new-window-icon.png" width="100"></td>
    <td>
Opens a new Hyper terminal window.  The default directory will be dictated by whatever defaults or hyper plugins that you have installed.  This is useful for invoking via a Spotlight search, as a dock icon, or (my fave) as the target of a global hotkey using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com).  Whenever I hit `cmd-opt-t`, a new hyper window pops open.  Note that since this script uses System Events, you will be prompted by a dialog the first time you run it to grant it access to control your computer via the Accessibility settings in the Security & Privacy system preference pane.

  <tr>
    <td nowrap style="font-size: 1.5em">hyper-open-dir-finder<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danlynn/hyper-applescripts/master/assets/hyper-open-dir-icon.png" width="100"></td>
    <td>
Opens a new Hyper terminal window/tab cd'd to the same directory as the currently front-most Finder window.  It is super useful to place this script app in the toolbar of your Finder windows.  To to this, open a Finder window then right-click on the window's toolbar and select 'Customize Toolbar...'.  You can then drag the hyper-open-dir-finder script to the toolbar.  Now, whenever you want to open a Hyper window/tab for the current folder, you can just click that icon.

    <td>
Opens a new Hyper terminal window/tab cd'd to the same directory as the currently front-most <a href="https://cocoatech.com/#/">PathFinder</a> window.  When a folder is selected, it will open a Hyper terminal window/tab cd'd to the directory that you have selected.  It is super useful to place this script app in the toolbar of your Finder windows.  This can be accomplished in the same manner as with the hyper-open-dir-finder script above.
